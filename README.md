üõ°Ô∏è Knighthacks Project: TK vs Lenny ‚Äì Titan Showdown

TK vs Lenny: Titan Showdown is a VR Roblox game where players take control of TK, a giant mech defending Orlando from the monstrous kaiju Lenny and his friends. For an extra layer of immersion, we integrated physical feedback using a TENS machine connected to an ESP32‚Äîplayers can actually feel the hits their mech takes!

This project was created for Knighthacks VIII as a hackathon submission.
